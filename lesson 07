## ⚙️ Three “layers” of the web:

**Surface Web**:
The normal internet — Google, YouTube, Wikipedia. Search engines can find it.

**Deep Web**:
Pages not indexed by search engines — like emails, private databases, or school portals.
(Most of what we use daily is actually part of the deep web — just private.)

**Dark Web**:
A small part of the deep web that’s intentionally hidden.
You need special browsers like Tor to access .onion sites.
It’s used for:

✅ Privacy, activism, journalism in restricted countries

❌ Illegal activity (drugs, stolen data, etc.)

⚠️ Important note:

- The dark web isn’t always illegal — it’s just hidden.
- But it’s not safe for casual browsing — lots of scams, malware, and shady stuff.
- Never access it unless you really know what you’re doing and have a reason (like cybersecurity research).
